# Lattice Simulations  
This repository contains various lattice simulations, mostly taken from the Advanced Lattice Field Theory course given by Felipe Attanasion at the University of Heidelberg in the Summer Semester 2022.  
## Phi4_2d  
Simulation of a Phi4 theory in 1+1 dimension using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. The magnetization is studied as a function of the mass parameter.  
## Polyakov Chain  
The Polyakov loop in 1+1 dimension is studied and compared to analytical results.  
## Lattice Exam  
Final project exam of the course, consists in a simulation of a SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions
